For our final project, we built a functional evaporative cooling system—or a small swamp cooler—using the Arduino 2560 and a mix of sensors from our lab kits. 
This system is designed to simulate how a real evaporative cooler works in dry climates: it pulls in hot air, passes it through some form of water, and cools the air as it evaporates. 
This cooler goes through different operational states, responding to sensor inputs and user inputs. It monitors the water level in a place and switches to an ERROR state when the level 
is too low. It also reads and displays the current temperature and humidity on an LCD screen using a sensor, refreshing one every minute. A fan turns on when the temperature gets too 
high and turns off once it drops back below the threshold. The vent angle can be controlled by the user. A very important part of the system is the states. The cooler can switch between
DISABLED, IDLE, RUNNING, and ERROR states based on button and sensor inputs. We used interrupts for the ON/OFF button. Every time the motor changes state, the timestamp is sent over the 
Serial connection to a computer. The entire system was created with code that included minimal use of Arduino libraries and included GPIO, timers, interrupts, and ADC. This project is a 
combination of embedded design concepts we learned throughout the semester: sensor interfacing, state machines, interrupts, real-time tracking, and actuator control—all pulled together 
to create a swamp cooler.
